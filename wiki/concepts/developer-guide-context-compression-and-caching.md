# Context Compression and Caching

# Context Compression and Caching

Hermes Agent uses a dual compression system and Anthropic prompt caching to
manage context window usage efficiently across long conversations.

Source files: `agent/context_engine.py` (ABC), `agent/context_compressor.py` (default engine),
`agent/prompt_caching.py`, `gateway/run.py` (session hygiene), `run_agent.py` (search for `_compress_context`)

## Pluggable Context Engine

Context management is built on the `ContextEngine` ABC (`agent/context_engine.py`). The built-in `ContextCompressor` is the default implementation, but plugins can replace it with alternative engines (e.g., Lossless Context Management).

```yaml
context:
  engine: "compressor"    # default — built-in lossy summarization
  engine: "lcm"           # example — plugin providing lossless context
```

The engine is responsible for:
- Deciding when compaction should fire (`should_compress()`)
- Performing compaction (`compress()`)
- Optionally exposing tools the agent can call (e.g., `lcm_grep`)
- Tr...

## Dual Compression System

Hermes has two separate compression layers that operate independently:

```
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
  Incoming message   │   Gateway Session Hygiene │  Fires at 85% of context
  ─────────────────► │   (pre-agent, rough est.) │  Safety net for large sessions
                     └─────────────┬────────────┘
                                   │
                                   ▼
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
                     │   Agent ContextCompressor │  Fires at 50% of context (default)
                     │   (in-loop, real tokens)  │  Norm...

## Configuration

All compression settings are read from `config.yaml` under the `compression` key:

```yaml
compression:
  enabled: true              # Enable/disable compression (default: true)
  threshold: 0.50            # Fraction of context window (default: 0.50 = 50%)
  target_ratio: 0.20         # How much of threshold to keep as tail (default: 0.20)
  protect_last_n: 20         # Minimum protected tail messages (default: 20)

# Summarization model/provider configured under auxiliary:
auxiliary:
  compression:
    model: null              # Override model for summaries (default: auto-detect)
    provide...

## Compression Algorithm

The `ContextCompressor.compress()` method follows a 4-phase algorithm:

### Phase 1: Prune Old Tool Results (cheap, no LLM call)

Old tool results (>200 chars) outside the protected tail are replaced with:
```
[Old tool output cleared to save context space]
```

This is a cheap pre-pass that saves significant tokens from verbose tool
outputs (file contents, terminal output, search results).

### Phase 2: Determine Boundaries

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Message list                                               │
│                                     ...

Summary budget scales with the amount of content being compressed:
- Formula: `content_tokens × 0.20` (the `_SUMMARY_RATIO` constant)
- Minimum: 2,000 tokens
- Maximum: `min(context_length × 0.05, 12,000)` tokens

### Phase 4: Assemble Compressed Messages

The compressed message list is:
1. Head messages (with a note appended to system prompt on first compression)
2. Summary message (role chosen to avoid consecutive same-role violations)
3. Tail messages (unmodified)

Orphaned tool_call/tool_result pairs are cleaned up by `_sanitize...

## Before/After Example

### Before Compression (45 messages, ~95K tokens)

```
[0] system:    "You are a helpful assistant..." (system prompt)
[1] user:      "Help me set up a FastAPI project"
[2] assistant: <tool_call> terminal: mkdir project </tool_call>
[3] tool:      "directory created"
[4] assistant: <tool_call> write_file: main.py </tool_call>
[5] tool:      "file written (2.3KB)"
    ... 30 more turns of file editing, testing, debugging ...
[38] assistant: <tool_call> terminal: pytest </tool_call>
[39] tool:      "8 passed, 2 failed\n..."  (5KB output)
[40] user:      "Fix the failing tests"
[41] assistant: <t...

## Prompt Caching (Anthropic)

Source: `agent/prompt_caching.py`

Reduces input token costs by ~75% on multi-turn conversations by caching the
conversation prefix. Uses Anthropic's `cache_control` breakpoints.

### Strategy: system_and_3

Anthropic allows a maximum of 4 `cache_control` breakpoints per request. Hermes
uses the "system_and_3" strategy:

```
Breakpoint 1: System prompt           (stable across all turns)
Breakpoint 2: 3rd-to-last non-system message  ─┐
Breakpoint 3: 2nd-to-last non-system message   ├─ Rolling window
Breakpoint 4: Last non-system message          ─┘
```

### How It Works

## Context Pressure Warnings

The agent emits context pressure warnings at 85% of the compression threshold
(not 85% of context — 85% of the threshold which is itself 50% of context):

```
⚠️  Context is 85% to compaction threshold (42,500/50,000 tokens)
```

After compression, if usage drops below 85% of threshold, the warning state
is cleared. If compression fails to reduce below the warning level (the
conversation is too dense), the warning persists but compression won't
re-trigger until the threshold is exceeded again....
