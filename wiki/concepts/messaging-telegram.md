# Telegram Setup

Hermes Agent integrates with Telegram as a full-featured conversational bot. Once connected, you can chat with your agent from any device, send voice memos that get auto-transcribed, receive scheduled task results, and use the agent in group chats. The integration is built on [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) and supports text, voice, images, and file attachments.

## Step 1: Create a Bot via BotFather

Every Telegram bot requires an API token issued by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), Telegram's official bot management tool.

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**, or visit [t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a **display name** (e.g., "Hermes Agent") — this can be anything
4. Choose a **username** — this must be unique and end in `bot` (e.g., `my_hermes_bot`)
5. BotFather replies with your **API token**. It looks like this:

```
123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
```

:::warning
Keep your bot token secret. Anyone with this token can control you...

## Step 2: Customize Your Bot (Optional)

These BotFather commands improve the user experience. Message @BotFather and use:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/setdescription` | The "What can this bot do?" text shown before a user starts chatting |
| `/setabouttext` | Short text on the bot's profile page |
| `/setuserpic` | Upload an avatar for your bot |
| `/setcommands` | Define the command menu (the `/` button in chat) |
| `/setprivacy` | Control whether the bot sees all group messages (see Step 3) |

:::tip
For `/setcommands`, a useful starting set:

```
help - Show help information
new - Start a new conversation
seth...

## Step 3: Privacy Mode (Critical for Groups)

Telegram bots have a **privacy mode** that is **enabled by default**. This is the single most common source of confusion when using bots in groups.

**With privacy mode ON**, your bot can only see:
- Messages that start with a `/` command
- Replies directly to the bot's own messages
- Service messages (member joins/leaves, pinned messages, etc.)
- Messages in channels where the bot is an admin

**With privacy mode OFF**, the bot receives every message in the group.

### How to disable privacy mode

1. Message **@BotFather**
2. Send `/mybots`
3. Select your bot
4. Go to **Bot Settings → Group P...

## Step 4: Find Your User ID

Hermes Agent uses numeric Telegram user IDs to control access. Your user ID is **not** your username — it's a number like `123456789`.

**Method 1 (recommended):** Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it instantly replies with your user ID.

**Method 2:** Message [@get_id_bot](https://t.me/get_id_bot) — another reliable option.

Save this number; you'll need it for the next step....

## Step 5: Configure Hermes

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **Telegram** when prompted. The wizard asks for your bot token and allowed user IDs, then writes the configuration for you.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Add the following to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789    # Comma-separated for multiple users
```

### Start the Gateway

```bash
hermes gateway
```

The bot should come online within seconds. Send it a message on Telegram to verify....

## Sending Generated Files from Docker-backed Terminals

If your terminal backend is `docker`, keep in mind that Telegram attachments are
sent by the **gateway process**, not from inside the container. That means the
final `MEDIA:/...` path must be readable on the host where the gateway is
running.

Common pitfall:

- the agent writes a file inside Docker to `/workspace/report.txt`
- the model emits `MEDIA:/workspace/report.txt`
- Telegram delivery fails because `/workspace/report.txt` only exists inside the
  container, not on the host

Recommended pattern:

```yaml
terminal:
  backend: docker
  docker_volumes:
    - "/home/user/.hermes/cache/docum...

## Webhook Mode

By default, Hermes connects to Telegram using **long polling** — the gateway makes outbound requests to Telegram's servers to fetch new updates. This works well for local and always-on deployments.

For **cloud deployments** (Fly.io, Railway, Render, etc.), **webhook mode** is more cost-effective. These platforms can auto-wake suspended machines on inbound HTTP traffic, but not on outbound connections. Since polling is outbound, a polling bot can never sleep. Webhook mode flips the direction — Telegram pushes updates to your bot's HTTPS URL, enabling sleep-when-idle deployments.

## Proxy Support

If Telegram's API is blocked or you need to route traffic through a proxy, set a Telegram-specific proxy URL. This takes priority over the generic `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` env vars.

**Option 1: config.yaml (recommended)**

```yaml
telegram:
  proxy_url: "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
```

**Option 2: environment variable**

```bash
TELEGRAM_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Supported schemes: `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`.

The proxy applies to both the main Telegram connection and the fallback IP transport. If no Telegram-specific proxy is set, the gateway falls back to `HTTPS_PROXY` / ...

## Home Channel

Use the `/sethome` command in any Telegram chat (DM or group) to designate it as the **home channel**. Scheduled tasks (cron jobs) deliver their results to this channel.

You can also set it manually in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=-1001234567890
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME="My Notes"
```

:::tip
Group chat IDs are negative numbers (e.g., `-1001234567890`). Your personal DM chat ID is the same as your user ID.
:::...

## Voice Messages

### Incoming Voice (Speech-to-Text)

Voice messages you send on Telegram are automatically transcribed by Hermes's configured STT provider and injected as text into the conversation.

- `local` uses `faster-whisper` on the machine running Hermes — no API key required
- `groq` uses Groq Whisper and requires `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `openai` uses OpenAI Whisper and requires `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`

### Outgoing Voice (Text-to-Speech)

When the agent generates audio via TTS, it's delivered as native Telegram **voice bubbles** — the round, inline-playable kind.

- **OpenAI and ElevenLabs** produce Opus n...

## Group Chat Usage

Hermes Agent works in Telegram group chats with a few considerations:

- **Privacy mode** determines what messages the bot can see (see [Step 3](#step-3-privacy-mode-critical-for-groups))
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` still applies — only authorized users can trigger the bot, even in groups
- You can keep the bot from responding to ordinary group chatter with `telegram.require_mention: true`
- With `telegram.require_mention: true`, group messages are accepted when they are:
  - slash commands
  - replies to one of the bot's messages
  - `@botusername` mentions
  - matches for one of your configur...

## Private Chat Topics (Bot API 9.4)

Telegram Bot API 9.4 (February 2026) introduced **Private Chat Topics** — bots can create forum-style topic threads directly in 1-on-1 DM chats, no supergroup needed. This lets you run multiple isolated workspaces within your existing DM with Hermes.

### Use case

If you work on several long-running projects, topics keep their context separate:

- **Topic "Website"** — work on your production web service
- **Topic "Research"** — literature review and paper exploration
- **Topic "General"** — miscellaneous tasks and quick questions

Each topic gets its own conversation session, history, and co...

## Group Forum Topic Skill Binding

Supergroups with **Topics mode** enabled (also called "forum topics") already get session isolation per topic — each `thread_id` maps to its own conversation. But you may want to **auto-load a skill** when messages arrive in a specific group topic, just like DM topic skill binding works.

### Use case

A team supergroup wit
