# Cron Troubleshooting

When a cron job isn't behaving as expected, work through these checks in order. Most issues fall into one of four categories: timing, delivery, permissions, or skill loading.

---

## Jobs Not Firing

### Check 1: Verify the job exists and is active

```bash
hermes cron list
```

Look for the job and confirm its state is `[active]` (not `[paused]` or `[completed]`). If it shows `[completed]`, the repeat count may be exhausted — edit the job to reset it.

### Check 2: Confirm the schedule is correct

A misformatted schedule silently defaults to one-shot or is rejected entirely. Test your expression:

| Your expression | Should evaluate to |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `0 9 * * *` | 9:00 AM every day |
| `0 9 * * 1` | 9:00 AM every Monday |
| `every 2h` | Every 2 hours from now |...

## Delivery Failures

### Check 1: Verify the deliver target is correct

Delivery targets are case-sensitive and require the correct platform to be configured. A misconfigured target silently drops the response.

| Target | Requires |
|--------|----------|
| `telegram` | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `~/.hermes/.env` |
| `discord` | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `~/.hermes/.env` |
| `slack` | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in `~/.hermes/.env` |
| `whatsapp` | WhatsApp gateway configured |
| `signal` | Signal gateway configured |
| `matrix` | Matrix homeserver configured |
| `email` | SMTP configured in `config.yaml` |
| `sms` | SMS provider...

## Skill Loading Failures

### Check 1: Verify skills are installed

```bash
hermes skills list
```

Skills must be installed before they can be attached to cron jobs. If a skill is missing, install it first with `hermes skills install <skill-name>` or via `/skills` in the CLI.

### Check 2: Check skill name vs. skill folder name

Skill names are case-sensitive and must match the installed skill's folder name. If your job specifies `ai-funding-daily-report` but the skill folder is `ai-funding-daily-report`, confirm the exact name from `hermes skills list`.

### Check 3: Skills that require interactive tools

Cron jobs r...

## Job Errors and Failures

### Check 1: Review recent job output

If a job ran and failed, you may see error context in:

1. The chat where the job delivers (if delivery succeeded)
2. `~/.hermes/logs/agent.log` for scheduler messages (or `errors.log` for warnings)
3. The job's `last_run` metadata via `hermes cron list`

### Check 2: Common error patterns

**"No such file or directory" for scripts**
The `script` path must be an absolute path (or relative to the Hermes config directory). Verify:
```bash
ls ~/.hermes/scripts/your-script.py   # Must exist
hermes cron edit <job_id> --script ~/.hermes/scripts/your-script.py
`...

## Performance Issues

### Slow job startup

Each cron job creates a fresh AIAgent session, which may involve provider authentication and model loading. For time-sensitive schedules, add buffer time (e.g., `0 8 * * *` instead of `0 9 * * *`).

### Too many overlapping jobs

The scheduler executes jobs sequentially within each tick. If multiple jobs are due at the same time, they run one after another. Consider staggering schedules (e.g., `0 9 * * *` and `5 9 * * *` instead of both at `0 9 * * *`) to avoid delays.

### Large script output

Scripts that dump megabytes of output will slow down the agent and may hit tok...

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
hermes cron list                    # Show all jobs, states, next_run times
hermes cron run <job_id>            # Schedule for next tick (for testing)
hermes cron edit <job_id>           # Fix configuration issues
hermes logs                         # View recent Hermes logs
hermes skills list                  # Verify installed skills
```

## Getting More Help

If you've worked through this guide and the issue persists:

1. Run the job with `hermes cron run <job_id>` (fires on next gateway tick) and watch for errors in the chat output
2. Check `~/.hermes/logs/agent.log` for scheduler messages and `~/.hermes/logs/errors.log` for warnings
3. Open an issue at [github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) with:
   - The job ID and schedule
   - The delivery target
   - What you expected vs. what happened
   - Relevant error messages from the logs
