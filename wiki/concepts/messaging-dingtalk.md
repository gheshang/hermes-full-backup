# DingTalk Setup

Hermes Agent integrates with DingTalk (钉钉) as a chatbot, letting you chat with your AI assistant through direct messages or group chats. The bot connects via DingTalk's Stream Mode — a long-lived WebSocket connection that requires no public URL or webhook server — and replies using markdown-formatted messages through DingTalk's session webhook API.

Before setup, here's the part most people want to know: how Hermes behaves once it's in your DingTalk workspace.

## How Hermes Behaves

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **DMs (1:1 chat)** | Hermes responds to every message. No `@mention` needed. Each DM has its own session. |
| **Group chats** | Hermes responds when you `@mention` it. Without a mention, Hermes ignores the message. |
| **Shared groups with multiple users** | By default, Hermes isolates session history per user inside the group. Two people talking in the same group do not share one transcript unless you explicitly disable that. |

### Session Model in DingTalk

By default:

- each DM gets its own session
- each user in a shared group chat gets the...

## Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install "hermes-agent[dingtalk]"
```

Or individually:

```bash
pip install dingtalk-stream httpx alibabacloud-dingtalk
```

- `dingtalk-stream` — DingTalk's official SDK for Stream Mode (WebSocket-based real-time messaging)
- `httpx` — async HTTP client used for sending replies via session webhooks
- `alibabacloud-dingtalk` — DingTalk OpenAPI SDK for AI Cards, emoji reactions, and media downloads...

## Step 1: Create a DingTalk App

1. Go to the [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/).
2. Log in with your DingTalk admin account.
3. Click **Application Development** → **Custom Apps** → **Create App via H5 Micro-App** (or **Robot** depending on your console version).
4. Fill in:
   - **App Name**: e.g., `Hermes Agent`
   - **Description**: optional
5. After creating, navigate to **Credentials & Basic Info** to find your **Client ID** (AppKey) and **Client Secret** (AppSecret). Copy both.

:::warning[Credentials shown only once]
The Client Secret is only displayed once when you create the app. If you los...

## Step 2: Enable the Robot Capability

1. In your app's settings page, go to **Add Capability** → **Robot**.
2. Enable the robot capability.
3. Under **Message Reception Mode**, select **Stream Mode** (recommended — no public URL needed).

:::tip
Stream Mode is the recommended setup. It uses a long-lived WebSocket connection initiated from your machine, so you don't need a public IP, domain name, or webhook endpoint. This works behind NAT, firewalls, and on local machines.

## Step 3: Find Your DingTalk User ID

Hermes Agent uses your DingTalk User ID to control who can interact with the bot. DingTalk User IDs are alphanumeric strings set by your organization's admin.

To find yours:

1. Ask your DingTalk organization admin — User IDs are configured in the DingTalk admin console under **Contacts** → **Members**.
2. Alternatively, the bot logs the `sender_id` for each incoming message. Start the gateway, send the bot a message, then check the logs for your ID....

## Step 4: Configure Hermes Agent

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run the guided setup command:

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **DingTalk** when prompted. The setup wizard can authorize via one of two paths:

- **QR-code device flow (recommended).** Scan the QR that prints in your terminal with the DingTalk mobile app — your Client ID and Client Secret are returned automatically and written to `~/.hermes/.env`. No developer-console trip needed.
- **Manual paste.** If you already have credentials (or QR scanning isn't convenient), paste your Client ID, Client Secret, and allowed user IDs when prompted....

## Features

### AI Cards

Hermes can reply using DingTalk AI Cards instead of plain markdown messages. Cards provide a richer, more structured display and support streaming updates as the agent generates its response.

To enable AI Cards, configure a card template ID in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  dingtalk:
    enabled: true
    extra:
      card_template_id: "your-card-template-id"
```

You can find your card template ID in the DingTalk Developer Console under your app's AI Card settings. When AI Cards are enabled, all replies are sent as cards with streaming text updates.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot is not responding to messages

**Cause**: The robot capability isn't enabled, or `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS` doesn't include your User ID.

**Fix**: Verify the robot capability is enabled in your app settings and that Stream Mode is selected. Check that your User ID is in `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS`. Restart the gateway.

### "dingtalk-stream not installed" error

**Cause**: The `dingtalk-stream` Python package is not installed.

**Fix**: Install it:

```bash
pip install dingtalk-stream httpx
```

### "DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID and DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET required"

**Cause**: The credentials aren't...

## Security

:::warning
Always set `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS` to restrict who can interact with the bot. Without it, the gateway denies all users by default as a safety measure. Only add User IDs of people you trust — authorized users have full access to the agent's capabilities, including tool use and system access.

## Notes

- **Stream Mode**: No public URL, domain name, or webhook server needed. The connection is initiated from your machine via WebSocket, so it works behind NAT and firewalls.
- **AI Cards**: Optionally reply with rich AI Cards instead of plain markdown. Configure via `card_template_id`.
- **Emoji Reactions**: Automatic 🤔Thinking/🥳Done reactions for processing status.
- **Markdown responses**: Replies are formatted in DingTalk's markdown format for rich text display.
- **Media support**: Images and files in incoming messages are automatically resolved and can be processed by vision tools.
- **Mess...
