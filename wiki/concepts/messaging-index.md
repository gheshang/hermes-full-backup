# Messaging Gateway

源文档：[Messaging Gateway](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/messaging/index.md)

# Messaging Gateway

Chat with Hermes from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, SMS, Email, Home Assistant, Mattermost, Matrix, DingTalk, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, Weixin, BlueBubbles (iMessage), QQ, or your browser. The gateway is a single background process that connects to all your configured platforms, handles sessions, runs cron jobs, and delivers voice messages.

For the full voice feature set — including CLI microphone mode, spoken replies in messaging, and Discord voice-channel conversations — see [Voice Mode](/docs/user-guide/features/voice-mode) and [Use Voice Mode with Hermes](/docs/guides/use-voice-mode-with-hermes).

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to configure messaging platforms is the interactive wizard:

```bash
hermes gateway setup        # Interactive setup for all messaging platforms
```

This walks you through configuring each platform with arrow-key selection, shows which platforms are already configured, and offers to start/restart the gateway when done....

## Gateway Commands

```bash
hermes gateway              # Run in foreground
hermes gateway setup        # Configure messaging platforms interactively
hermes gateway install      # Install as a user service (Linux) / launchd service (macOS)
sudo hermes gateway install --system   # Linux only: install a boot-time system service
hermes gateway start        # Start the default service
hermes gateway stop         # Stop the default service
hermes gateway status       # Check default service status
hermes gateway status --system         # Linux only: inspect the system service explicitly
```...

## Chat Commands (Inside Messaging)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` or `/reset` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/model [provider:model]` | Show or change the model (supports `provider:model` syntax) |
| `/personality [name]` | Set a personality |
| `/retry` | Retry the last message |
| `/undo` | Remove the last exchange |
| `/status` | Show session info |
| `/stop` | Stop the running agent |
| `/approve` | Approve a pending dangerous command |
| `/deny` | Reject a pending dangerous command |
| `/sethome` | Set this chat as the home channel |
| `/compress` | Manually compress conversation context |
...

## Session Management

### Session Persistence

Sessions persist across messages until they reset. The agent remembers your conversation context.

### Reset Policies

Sessions reset based on configurable policies:

| Policy | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Daily | 4:00 AM | Reset at a specific hour each day |
| Idle | 1440 min | Reset after N minutes of inactivity |
| Both | (combined) | Whichever triggers first |

Configure per-platform overrides in `~/.hermes/gateway.json`:

```json
{
  "reset_by_platform": {
    "telegram": { "mode": "idle", "idle_minutes": 240 },
    "discord": { "m...

## Security

**By default, the gateway denies all users who are not in an allowlist or paired via DM.** This is the safe default for a bot with terminal access.

```bash
# Restrict to specific users (recommended):
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678
SIGNAL_ALLOWED_USERS=+155****4567,+155****6543
SMS_ALLOWED_USERS=+155****4567,+155****6543
EMAIL_ALLOWED_USERS=trusted@example.com,colleague@work.com
MATTERMOST_ALLOWED_USERS=3uo8dkh1p7g1mfk49ear5fzs5c
MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS=@alice:matrix.org
DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS=user-id-1
FEISHU_ALLOWED_USERS=ou_xxxxxxxx,ou_yyyyy...

## Interrupting the Agent

Send any message while the agent is working to interrupt it. Key behaviors:

- **In-progress terminal commands are killed immediately** (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 1s)
- **Tool calls are cancelled** — only the currently-executing one runs, the rest are skipped
- **Multiple messages are combined** — messages sent during interruption are joined into one prompt
- **`/stop` command** — interrupts without queuing a follow-up message...

## Tool Progress Notifications

Control how much tool activity is displayed in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
display:
  tool_progress: all    # off | new | all | verbose
  tool_progress_command: false  # set to true to enable /verbose in messaging
```

When enabled, the bot sends status messages as it works:

```text
💻 `ls -la`...
🔍 web_search...
📄 web_extract...
🐍 execute_code...
```...

## Background Sessions

Run a prompt in a separate background session so the agent works on it independently while your main chat stays responsive:

```
/background Check all servers in the cluster and report any that are down
```

Hermes confirms immediately:

```
🔄 Background task started: "Check all servers in the cluster..."
   Task ID: bg_143022_a1b2c3
```

### How It Works

Each `/background` prompt spawns a **separate agent instance** that runs asynchronously:

- **Isolated session** — the background agent has its own session with its own conversation history. It has no knowledge of your current chat context a...

## Service Management

### Linux (systemd)

```bash
hermes gateway install               # Install as user service
hermes gateway start                 # Start the service
hermes gateway stop                  # Stop the service
hermes gateway status                # Check status
journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -f  # View logs

# Enable lingering (keeps running after logout)
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER

# Or install a boot-time system service that still runs as your user
sudo hermes gateway install --system
sudo hermes gateway start --system
sudo hermes gateway status --system
journalctl -u hermes-gateway -...
