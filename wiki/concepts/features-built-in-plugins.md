# Built-in Plugins

# Built-in Plugins

Hermes ships a small set of plugins bundled with the repository. They live under `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` and load automatically alongside user-installed plugins in `~/.hermes/plugins/`. They use the same plugin surface as third-party plugins — hooks, tools, slash commands — just maintained in-tree.

See the [Plugins](/docs/user-guide/features/plugins) page for the general plugin system, and [Build a Hermes Plugin](/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin) to write your own.

## How discovery works

The `PluginManager` scans four sources, in order:

1. **Bundled** — `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` (what this page documents)
2. **User** — `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/`
3. **Project** — `./.hermes/plugins/<name>/` (requires `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS=1`)
4. **Pip entry points** — `hermes_agent.plugins`

On name collision, later sources win — a user plugin named `disk-cleanup` would replace the bundled one.

`plugins/memory/` and `plugins/context_engine/` are deliberately excluded from bundled scanning. Those directories use their own discovery paths because memory providers and context engines ar...

## Bundled plugins are opt-in

Bundled plugins ship disabled. Discovery finds them (they appear in `hermes plugins list` and the interactive `hermes plugins` UI), but none load until you explicitly enable them:

```bash
hermes plugins enable disk-cleanup
```

Or via `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - disk-cleanup
```

This is the same mechanism user-installed plugins use. Bundled plugins are never auto-enabled — not on fresh install, not for existing users upgrading to a newer Hermes. You always opt in explicitly.

To turn a bundled plugin off again:

```bash
hermes plugins disable disk-cleanup
# or...

## Currently shipped

### disk-cleanup

Auto-tracks and removes ephemeral files created during sessions — test scripts, temp outputs, cron logs, stale chrome profiles — without requiring the agent to remember to call a tool.

**How it works:**

| Hook | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `post_tool_call` | When `write_file` / `terminal` / `patch` creates a file matching `test_*`, `tmp_*`, or `*.test.*` inside `HERMES_HOME` or `/tmp/hermes-*`, track it silently as `test` / `temp` / `cron-output`. |
| `on_session_end` | If any test files were auto-tracked during the turn, run the safe `quick` cleanup and log a one-line summary....

## Adding a bundled plugin

Bundled plugins are written exactly like any other Hermes plugin — see [Build a Hermes Plugin](/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin). The only differences are:

- Directory lives at `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` instead of `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/`
- Manifest source is reported as `bundled` in `hermes plugins list`
- User plugins with the same name override the bundled version

A plugin is a good candidate for bundling when:

- It has no optional dependencies (or they're already `pip install .[all]` deps)
- The behaviour benefits most users and is opt-out rather than opt-in
- The logic ties into li...
