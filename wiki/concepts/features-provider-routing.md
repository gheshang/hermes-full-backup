# Provider Routing

# Provider Routing

When using [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) as your LLM provider, Hermes Agent supports **provider routing** — fine-grained control over which underlying AI providers handle your requests and how they're prioritized.

OpenRouter routes requests to many providers (e.g., Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, Together AI). Provider routing lets you optimize for cost, speed, quality, or enforce specific provider requirements.

## Configuration

Add a `provider_routing` section to your `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
provider_routing:
  sort: "price"           # How to rank providers
  only: []                # Whitelist: only use these providers
  ignore: []              # Blacklist: never use these providers
  order: []               # Explicit provider priority order
  require_parameters: false  # Only use providers that support all parameters
  data_collection: null   # Control data collection ("allow" or "deny")
```

:::info
Provider routing only applies when using OpenRouter. It has no effect with direct provider connections (...

## Options

### `sort`

Controls how OpenRouter ranks available providers for your request.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"price"` | Cheapest provider first |
| `"throughput"` | Fastest tokens-per-second first |
| `"latency"` | Lowest time-to-first-token first |

```yaml
provider_routing:
  sort: "price"
```

### `only`

Whitelist of provider names. When set, **only** these providers will be used. All others are excluded.

```yaml
provider_routing:
  only:
    - "Anthropic"
    - "Google"
```

### `ignore`

Blacklist of provider names. These providers will **never** be used, even if ...

## Practical Examples

### Optimize for Cost

Route to the cheapest available provider. Good for high-volume usage and development:

```yaml
provider_routing:
  sort: "price"
```

### Optimize for Speed

Prioritize low-latency providers for interactive use:

```yaml
provider_routing:
  sort: "latency"
```

### Optimize for Throughput

Best for long-form generation where tokens-per-second matters:

```yaml
provider_routing:
  sort: "throughput"
```

### Lock to Specific Providers

Ensure all requests go through a specific provider for consistency:

```yaml
provider_routing:
  only:
    - "Anthropic"
```

### Avoid Sp...

## How It Works

Provider routing preferences are passed to the OpenRouter API via the `extra_body.provider` field on every API call. This applies to both:

- **CLI mode** — configured in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, loaded at startup
- **Gateway mode** — same config file, loaded when the gateway starts

The routing config is read from `config.yaml` and passed as parameters when creating the `AIAgent`:

```
providers_allowed  ← from provider_routing.only
providers_ignored  ← from provider_routing.ignore
providers_order    ← from provider_routing.order
provider_sort      ← from provider_routing.sort
provider_requir...

## Default Behavior

When no `provider_routing` section is configured (the default), OpenRouter uses its own default routing logic, which generally balances cost and availability automatically.

:::tip Provider Routing vs. Fallback Models
Provider routing controls which **sub-providers within OpenRouter** handle your requests. For automatic failover to an entirely different provider when your primary model fails, see [Fallback Providers](/docs/user-guide/features/fallback-providers).
