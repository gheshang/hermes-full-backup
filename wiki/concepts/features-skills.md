# Skills System

Skills are on-demand knowledge documents the agent can load when needed. They follow a **progressive disclosure** pattern to minimize token usage and are compatible with the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard.

All skills live in **`~/.hermes/skills/`** — the primary directory and source of truth. On fresh install, bundled skills are copied from the repo. Hub-installed and agent-created skills also go here. The agent can modify or delete any skill.

You can also point Hermes at **external skill directories** — additional folders scanned alongside the local one. See [External Skill Directories](#external-skill-directories) below.

## Using Skills

Every installed skill is automatically available as a slash command:

```bash
# In the CLI or any messaging platform:
/gif-search funny cats
/axolotl help me fine-tune Llama 3 on my dataset
/github-pr-workflow create a PR for the auth refactor
/plan design a rollout for migrating our auth provider

# Just the skill name loads it and lets the agent ask what you need:
/excalidraw
```

The bundled `plan` skill is a good example. Running `/plan [request]` loads the skill's instructions, telling Hermes to inspect context if needed, write a markdown implementation plan instead of executing the task,...

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a token-efficient loading pattern:

```
Level 0: skills_list()           → [{name, description, category}, ...]   (~3k tokens)
Level 1: skill_view(name)        → Full content + metadata       (varies)
Level 2: skill_view(name, path)  → Specific reference file       (varies)
```

The agent only loads the full skill content when it actually needs it....

### Platform-Specific Skills

Skills can restrict themselves to specific operating systems using the `platforms` field:

| Value | Matches |
|-------|---------|
| `macos` | macOS (Darwin) |
| `linux` | Linux |
| `windows` | Windows |

```yaml
platforms: [macos]            # macOS only (e.g., iMessage, Apple Reminders, FindMy)
platforms: [macos, linux]     # macOS and Linux
```

When set, the skill is automatically hidden from the system prompt, `skills_list()`, and slash commands on incompatible platforms. If omitted, the skill loads on all platforms.

## Secure Setup on Load

Skills can declare required environment variables without disappearing from discovery:

```yaml
required_environment_variables:
  - name: TENOR_API_KEY
    prompt: Tenor API key
    help: Get a key from https://developers.google.com/tenor
    required_for: full functionality
```

When a missing value is encountered, Hermes asks for it securely only when the skill is actually loaded in the local CLI. You can skip setup and keep using the skill. Messaging surfaces never ask for secrets in chat — they tell you to use `hermes setup` or `~/.hermes/.env` locally instead.

Once set, declared env vars...

## External Skill Directories

If you maintain skills outside of Hermes — for example, a shared `~/.agents/skills/` directory used by multiple AI tools — you can tell Hermes to scan those directories too.

Add `external_dirs` under the `skills` section in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - ~/.agents/skills
    - /home/shared/team-skills
    - ${SKILLS_REPO}/skills
```

Paths support `~` expansion and `${VAR}` environment variable substitution.

### How it works

- **Read-only**: External dirs are only scanned for skill discovery. When the agent creates or edits a skill, it always writes to `~/....

## Agent-Managed Skills (skill_manage tool)

The agent can create, update, and delete its own skills via the `skill_manage` tool. This is the agent's **procedural memory** — when it figures out a non-trivial workflow, it saves the approach as a skill for future reuse.

### When the Agent Creates Skills

- After completing a complex task (5+ tool calls) successfully
- When it hit errors or dead ends and found the working path
- When the user corrected its approach
- When it discovered a non-trivial workflow

### Actions

| Action | Use for | Key params |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `create` | New skill from scratch | `name`, `cont...

## Skills Hub

Browse, search, install, and manage skills from online registries, `skills.sh`, direct well-known skill endpoints, and official optional skills.

### Common commands

```bash
hermes skills browse                              # Browse all hub skills (official first)
hermes skills browse --source official            # Browse only official optional skills
hermes skills search kubernetes                   # Search all sources
hermes skills search react --source skills-sh     # Search the skills.sh directory
hermes skills search https://mintlify.com/docs --source well-known
hermes skills inspect op...

## Bundled skill updates (`hermes skills reset`)

Hermes ships with a set of bundled skills in `skills/` inside the repo. On install and on every `hermes update`, a sync pass copies those into `~/.hermes/skills/` and records a manifest at `~/.hermes/skills/.bundled_manifest` mapping each skill name to the content hash at the time it was synced (the **origin hash**).

On each sync, Hermes recomputes the hash of your local copy and compares it to the origin hash:

- **Unchanged** → safe to pull upstream changes, copy the new bundled version in, record the new origin hash.
- **Changed** → treated as **user-modified** and skipped forever, so your...
